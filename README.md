### Hi, I'm Gianna 👋

I'm a multidisciplinary engineer with a background in Mechanical Engineering, Sales, and Marketing through my experiences in the telecommunications, lasers, and network interconnects industries. I started playing videogames before I could read, which eventually taught me how to speak English, my second language! I currently specialize as a Front-End developer and working towards Full Stack.

### 🔭 My current projects
🧙 Visual Novel - I am developing a witch-themed visual novel as an indie game dev using Ren'Py. <br>
🖥️ Interactive Website - I am making an interactive website reminiscent of the Adobe Flash games era, my favorite era.<br>
💃 Dance Performance - I am in a performance troupe that is preparing for a huge performance in November!<br>


### 📖 Courses I'm currently taking
* [Freecodecamp's Core Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)
* [Google Project Management Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-project-management)
* [Meta Front End Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer?)



## About me
🌱 I have a green thumb and love experimenting with my plants (I recently made a Ratatouille with my tomatoes and they were the best according to my brother!)

✏️ I dabble in the art of drawing, turning ideas into vibrant visual tales (I have done art for multiple indie videogames for game jam entries!)

💃 I dance in my free time and have performed in various competitions, community performances, and stages all through California, USA!

🎮 Leveling up isn't just for code! I'm a gamer at heart, conquering virtual worlds and vanquishing foes. Let's squad up and hit the battlefield!
